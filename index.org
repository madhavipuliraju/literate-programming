* Objective
  The objective of this documentation is to learn literate programming with example.
* Introduction
*Literate porgramming* 
It enhances traditional software dovelopment by emedding code in explanatory essays and encourages treating the act of development as one of communication with future maintainers. 
* Pre-requisites
  Emacs editor installed (advisable latest version 24.x.x)
* Procedure
  *Step 1:* Open emacs through terminal using command
 #+begin_src shell
 emacs <filename>
 #+end_src
 *step 2:* make sure that file is in  =org-mode= if not change using
 #+begin_src shell
 M-x org-mode
 #+end_src 
*step 3:* Include profile using
#+begin_src shell
M-x org-insert-export-options-template
#+end_src
*step 4:* Include following properties and edit property of tangle =<filename>= w.r.t language (e.g hello.py, hello.java and hello.c)
#+begin_src shell 
#+PROPERTY: session *scratch*
#+PROPERTY: results output
#+PROPERTY: tangle <filename>
#+PROPERTY: exports code
#+end_src 
*step 5:* Start writing documentation followed by code make sure that code embeded in =#+begin_src python= and =#+end_src=
*step 6:* Now extract the source code from documentation using following cammand, It will prompt for file name give =<filename>.org= file as input
#+begin_src shell
M-x org-babel-tangle-file
#+end_src 
*step 7:* Now check tangle file in current directory if not exported kill the =<filename>.org= using =C-x k= and reload it.
* Example
Try this  [[./example.org][example]] to export [[./example.py][tanglefile]]
